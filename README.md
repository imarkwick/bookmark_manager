# Bookmark Manager

This week's challenge at Makers Academy was to build a bookmark manager.
A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of links, organised by tags. You can use it to save webpages you find useful and browse links other users have added.

## Objectives:

Learn about database web apps in Ruby using Sinatra and an introduction to front end design using CSS. 

The website will have the following options:

* Show a list of links from the database
* Add new links
* Add tags to the links
* Filter links by a tag

## Technologies used:

* Ruby
* Sinatra
* HTML5
* CSS
* RSpec
* Capybara
* Cucumber
* DataMapper
* Postgres

## How to run tests:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/imarkwick/bookmark_manager.git
$ cd bookmark_manager
$ rspec
```

## How to run the server:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/imarkwick/bookmark_manager.git
$ cd bookmark_manager
$ bundle install
$ rackup
```
