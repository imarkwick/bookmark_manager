#Bookmark Manager

This week's challenge at Makers Academy was to build a bookmark manager, similar to pineapple.io or delicious.com. 

The aim of the project was to learn about database web apps in Ruby using Sinatra. Also to provide an example of how relational databases work as well as get an introduction to css and front end design. 

A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of links, organised by tags. You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse links other users have added.

The website will have the following options:

* Show a list of links from the database
* Add new links
* Add tags to the links
* Filter links by a tag

To view tests run rspec;

```sh
$ rspec
```

To view in the browser, use rackup and visit localhost/9292;

```sh
$ rackup
```
